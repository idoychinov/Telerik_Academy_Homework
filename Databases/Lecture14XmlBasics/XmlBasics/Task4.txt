Uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a resource. 
Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. 

A URL is a URI that, in addition to identifying a web resource, specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation, 
specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location.

A URN is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace. 
A URN can be used to talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it.
